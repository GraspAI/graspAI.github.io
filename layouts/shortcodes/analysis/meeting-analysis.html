    <h1 class="page-header">Why This Matters</h1>
    <p class="page-paragraph">
        In today's fast-paced business world, time is more than just money – it's innovation, growth, and employee
        satisfaction all rolled into one. When meetings become black holes of productivity, we're not just losing time;
        we're losing:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Creative breakthroughs that could revolutionize your industry</li>
        <li>Team momentum that drives project success</li>
        <li>Employee engagement that fuels company culture</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="page-header">The Research Behind the Reality</h1>
    <p class="page-paragraph">
        Studies from Harvard Business Review and MIT Sloan Management Review highlight that ineffective meetings don't
        just waste time – they create a ripple effect of organizational inefficiency. The average executive spends 33
        hours per week in meetings, up from 4 hours in the 1960s. That's more than triple the meeting time, but are we
        three times more productive?

    <h1 class="page-header">Breaking Free from Meeting Mayhem</h1>
    <p class="page-paragraph">
        Imagine a world where:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Every brainstorming session captures and preserves game-changing ideas</li>
        <li>Task follow-ups happen automatically and effectively</li>
        <li>Decision trails are clear, accessible, and actionable</li>
        <li>Meetings actually move projects forward instead of becoming discussion loops</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="page-paragraph">
        This isn't just a dream – it's what we're building. Our solution transforms the way teams collaborate, ensuring
        that every minute spent in meetings drives real value and tangible outcomes.
