# The Problem
We spend one-third of our working time in meetings. **47%** of respondents in a study consider their meetings to be a waste of time. Why is that?

- **80%** of ideas from brainstorming sessions are lost.
- **40%** of delays are caused by inefficient task follow-ups.
- **60%** of employees cannot trace decisions made within their department.
